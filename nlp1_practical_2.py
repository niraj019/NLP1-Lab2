# Practical 2: Encoding Sentences with Neural Models

In this practical we will train neural models to encode sentences, after which we can use our sentence representation for a downstream task such as sentiment classification. Rather than simply answering questions, like in the previous lab, **this time you are expected to write a four-page scientific report with your findings**. You will be judged by the quality of your report (see below). In this notebook, we will help you to develop models for your experiments. You do not have to hand in your answers, but please do include a link to a private Github gist with your code in your report as a footnote. 

### Data set
We will make use of the [Stanford Sentiment Treebank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/) (SST), which provides sentences, their tree structure, and (fine-grained) sentiment scores.
This dataset is different from the one we used in the first practical. 
Before, a review consisted of several sentences, and we would have one sentiment score for it. Now, a review is a single sentence, for which we get a sentiment score. The special thing about our new data set is that we get a binary parse tree for each sentence, and a sentiment score has been assigned to each node in the tree. (We will look at an example below.)

For the first part of this practical we will only make use of the tokens, but in the end we will also exploit the tree-structure that is provided!

We will cover the following approaches:

- Bag-of-words (BOW)
- Continuous bag-of-words (CBOW)
- Deep continuous bag-of-words (Deep CBOW)
- LSTM
- TreeLSTM

### Important: Report 

The main purpose of this lab is for you to learn how to answer research questions by experimenting and then writing a scientific report.
Your grade will be based on the quality of your report, not on the exercises in this notebook.
You can find the requirements for the report at the end of this notebook.

"""#### Exercise: Training function

Your task is now to complete the training loop below.
Before you do so, please read the section about optimization.

**Optimization**

As mentioned in the "Introduction to PyTorch" notebook, one of the perks of using PyTorch are its automatic differentiation abilities. We will use these to train our BOW model. 

We train our model by feeding it an input and performing **forward** pass, which results in an output for which we obtain a **loss** with our loss function.
After the gradients are calculated in the **backward** pass, we can take a step on the loss surface towards more optimal parameter settings (e.g. gradient descent). 

The package we will use to do this optimization is [torch.optim](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html). Besides implementations of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), this package also implements the optimization algorithm Adam, which we'll be using in this practical. 
For the purposes of this assignment you do not need to know what Adam does besides that it uses gradient information to update our model parameters by calling: 

```
optimizer.step()
```
Remember when we updated our parameters in the PyTorch tutorial in a loop?


```python
# update weights
learning_rate = 0.5
for f in net.parameters():
    # for each parameter, take a small step in the opposite dir of the gradient
    p.data = p.data - p.grad.data * learning_rate

```
The function call optimizer.step() does effectively the same thing.

*(If you want to know more about optimization algorithms using gradient information [this blog](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/.) gives a nice intuitive overview.)*

We now continue with a **continuous bag-of-words (CBOW)** model.
It is similar to the BOW model, but now embeddings can have a dimension of *arbitrary size*. 
This means that we can make them bigger and learn more aspects of each word. We will still sum the vectors to get a sentence representation, but now the result is no longer conveniently the number of sentiment classes. 

*Note that this is not the same as word2vec CBOW.* Both models take a few words as input, sum and make a prediction. However, in word2vec the prediction is the word in the middle of the input words. Here, the prediction is a sentiment class (1 out of 5 possible numbers 0-4).

So what can we do? We can *learn* a parameter matrix $W$ that turns our summed vector into the number of output classes, by matrix-multiplying it: $$Wx$$
If the size of $W$ is `5 x d`, and $x$ is `d x 1` and , then the result will be `5x1`, and then we can again find our prediction using an argmax.

## Exercise: write CBOW class & train it

Write a class `CBOW` that:

- has word embeddings with size 300
- sums the word vectors for the input words (just like in `BOW`)
- projects the resulting vector down to 5 units using a linear layer (including a bias term)

"""# Deep CBOW

To see if we can squeeze some more performance out of the CBOW model, we can make it deeper and non-linear: add more layers and tanh-activations.
By using more parameters we can learn more aspects of the data, and by using more layers and non-linearities, we can try to learn a more complex function. 
This is not something that always works. If the input-output mapping of your data is simple, then a complicated function could easily overfit on your training set, which will lead to poor generalization. 

We will use E for the size of the word embeddings (use: 300) and D for the size of a hidden layer (use: 100).

#### Exercise: write Deep CBOW class and train it

Write a class `DeepCBOW`.

In your code, make sure that your `output_layer` consists of the following:
- A linear transformation from E units to D units.
- A Tanh activation
- A linear transformation from D units to D units
- A Tanh activation
- A linear transformation from D units to 5 units (our output classes).

We recommend using [nn.Sequential](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=sequential#torch.nn.Sequential) to implement this exercise.

"""# Pre-trained word embeddings

The Stanford sentiment treebank is a very small data set, since it was manually annotated. This makes it difficult for the model to learn good word embeddings, to learn the "meaning" of the words in our vocabulary.

Think for a moment about the fact that the only error signal that the network receives is from predicting the sentiment!

To mitigate our data sparsity, we can download **pre-trained word embeddings**. 
You can choose which pre-trained word embeddings to use:

- **Glove**. The "original" Stanford Sentiment classification [paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P15/P15-1150.pdf) used Glove embeddings, which are just another method (like *word2vec*) to get word embeddings from unannotated text. Glove is described in the following paper which you should cite if you use them:
> Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher Manning. ["Glove: Global vectors for word representation."](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) EMNLP 2014. 

- **word2vec**. This is the method that you learned about in class, described in:
> Mikolov, Tomas, et al. ["Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality."](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf) Advances in neural information processing systems. 2013.

With these pre-trained word embeddings, we can initialize our word embedding lookup table and start form a point where similar words are already close to one another. 

You can choose to keep the word embeddings **fixed** or to train them further.
We will keep them fixed for now.

For the purposes of this lab, it is enough if you understand how word2vec works (whichever vectors you use). If you are interested you may also check out the Glove paper.

You can either download the word2vec vectors, or the Glove vectors.
If you want to compare your results to the Stanford paper later on, then you should use Glove. 
**At the end of this lab you have the option to compare which vectors give you the best performance. For now, simply choose one of them and continue with that.**

"""**It looks like we've hit what is possible with just using words.**
Let's move on by incorporating word order!

# LSTM

It is time to get more serious. Even with pre-trained word embeddings and multiple layers, we seem to do pretty badly at sentiment classification here. 
The next step we can take is to introduce word order again, and to get a representation of the sentence as a whole, without independence assumptions.

We will get this representation using an **Long Short-Term Memory** (LSTM). As an exercise, we will code our own LSTM cell, so that we get comfortable with its inner workings.
Once we have an LSTM cell, we can call it repeatedly, updating its hidden state one word at a time:

```python
rnn = MyLSTMCell(input_size, hidden_size)

hx = torch.zeros(1, hidden_size)  # initial state
cx = torch.zeros(1, hidden_size)  # initial memory cell
output = []                       # to save intermediate LSTM states

# feed one word at a time
for i in range(n_timesteps):
  hx, cx = rnn(input[i], (hx, cx))
  output.append(hx)
```

        i = \sigma(W_{ii} x + b_{ii} + W_{hi} h + b_{hi}) \\
        f = \sigma(W_{if} x + b_{if} + W_{hf} h + b_{hf}) \\
        g = \tanh(W_{ig} x + b_{ig} + W_{hg} h + b_{hg}) \\
        o = \sigma(W_{io} x + b_{io} + W_{ho} h + b_{ho}) \\
        c' = f * c + i * g \\
        h' = o \tanh(c') \\
\end{array}

"""#### Optional: Efficient Matrix Multiplication

It is more efficient to do a few big matrix multiplications than to do many smaller ones.

It is possible to implement the above cell using just **two** linear layers.

This is because the eight linear transformations from one forward pass through an LSTM cell can be done in just two:
$$W_h h + b_h$$
$$W_i x + b_i $$ 

with $h = $ `prev_h` and $x = $ `input_`.

and where: 

$W_h =  \begin{pmatrix}
W_{hi}\\ 
W_{hf}\\ 
W_{hg}\\ 
W_{ho}
\end{pmatrix}$, $b_h = \begin{pmatrix}
b_{hi}\\ 
b_{hf}\\

Convince yourself that, after chunking with [torch.chunk](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?highlight=chunk#torch.chunk), the output of those two linear transformations is equivalent to the output of the eight linear transformations in the LSTM cell calculations above.

"""#### Dropout

Besides not being able to learn meaningful word embeddings, there is another negative effect that can follow from data sparsity and a small data set: *overfitting*. This is a phenomenom that is very likely to occur when fitting strong and expressive models, like LSTMs, to small data. In practice, if your model overfits, this means that it will be very good at predicting (or: 'remembering') the sentiment of the training set, but unable to generalize to new, unseen data in the test set. This is undesirable and one technique to mitigate it is *dropout*. 

A dropout layer is defined by the following formula: $\mathbf{d} \in \{0, 1\}^n$, with $d_j \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$, and can be applied to for example a linear layer:

$$\text{tanh}(W(\mathbf{h}\odot \mathbf{d}) + \mathbf{b})$$


These formulas simply mean that we *drop* certain parameters during training (by setting them to zero). Which parameters we drop is stochastically determined by a Bernoulli distribution and the probability of each parameter being dropped is set to $p = 0.5$ in our experiments (see the previous cell of code where we define our output layer). A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect where our model relies on single parameters for  prediction (e.g. if $h^{\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable when generalizing to unseen data.

**Let's train our LSTM! ** Note that is will be a lot slower, because we need to do many more computations per sentence!

"""# Mini-batching

**Why is the LSTM so slow?** Despite our best efforts, we still need to make a lot of matrix multiplications per example (linear in the length of the example) just to get a single classification, and we can only process the 2nd word once we have computed the hidden state for the 1st word (sequential computation).

GPUs are more efficient if we do a few big matrix multiplications, rather than lots of small ones. If we could process multiple examples at the same time, then we could exploit that. We still process the input sequentially, but now we can do so for multiple sentences at the same time.

Up to now our "minibatch" consisted of a single example. This was for a reason: the sentences in our data sets have **different lengths**, and this makes it difficult to process them at the same time.

Consider a batch of 2 sentences:

```
this movie is bad
this movie is super cool !
```

Let's say the IDs for these sentences are:

```
2 3 4 5
2 3 4 6 7 8
```

We cannot feed PyTorch an object with variable length rows! We need to turn this into a matrix.

The solution is to add **padding values** to our mini-batch:

```
2 3 4 5 1 1
2 3 4 6 7 8
```

Whenever a sentence is shorter than the longest sentence in a mini-batch, we just use a padding value (here: 1) to fill the matrix.

In our computation, we should **ignore** the padding positions (e.g. mask them out). Paddings should not contribute to the loss.

"""# Tree LSTM

In the final part of this lab we will exploit the tree-structure of our data. 
Until now we only used the surface tokens, but remember that our data examples include trees with a sentiment score at every node.

In particular, we will implement **N-ary Tree-LSTMs** which are described in:

> Kai Sheng Tai, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning. [Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P15/P15-1150.pdf) ACL 2015.

Since our trees are binary, N=2, and we can refer to these as *Binary Tree-LSTMs*.

You should read this paper carefully and make sure that you understand the approach. You will also find our LSTM baseline there.
Note however that Tree LSTMs were also invented around the same time by two other groups:

> Phong Le and Willem Zuidema. [Compositional distributional semantics with long short term memory](http://anthology.aclweb.org/S/S15/S15-1002.pdf). *SEM 2015.

> Xiaodan Zhu, Parinaz Sobihani,  and Hongyu Guo. [Long short-term memory over recursive structures](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/zhub15.pdf). ICML 2015.

It is good scientific practice to cite all three papers in your report.

If you study equations (9) to (14) in the paper, you will find that they are not all too different from the original LSTM that you already have.

## Computation

Do you remember the `transitions_from_treestring` function all the way in the beginning of this lab? Every example contains a **transition sequence** made by this function. Let's look at it again:
"""

ex = next(examplereader("trees/dev.txt"))
print(TreePrettyPrinter(ex.tree))
print("Transitions:")
print(ex.transitions)

"""Note that the tree is **binary**. Every node has two children, except for pre-terminal nodes.

A tree like this can be described by a sequence of **SHIFT (0)** and **REDUCE (1)** actions.

We can use the transitions like this to construct the tree:
- **reverse** the sentence (a list of tokens) and call this the **buffer**
   - the first word is now on top (last in the list), and we would get it when calling pop() on the buffer
- create an empty list and call it the **stack**
- iterate through the transition sequence:
  - if it says SHIFT(0), we pop a word from the buffer, and push it to the stack
  - if it says REDUCE(1), we pop the **top two items** from the stack, and combine them (e.g. with a tree LSTM!), creating a new node that we push back on the stack
  
Convince yourself that going through the transition sequence above will result in the tree that you see.
For example, we would start by putting the following words on the stack (by shifting 5 times, starting with `It`):

```
Top of the stack:
-----------------
film
lovely
a 
's  
It
```
Now we find a REDUCE in the transition sequence, so we get the top two words (film and lovely), and combine them, so our new stack becomes:
```
Top of the stack:
-----------------
lovely film
a 
's  
It
```

We will use this approach when encoding sentences with our Tree LSTM.
Now, our sentence is a (reversed) list of word embeddings.
When we shift, we move a word embedding to the stack.
When we reduce, we apply a Tree LSTM to the top two vectors, and the result is a single vector that we put back on the stack.
After going through the whole transition sequence, we will have the root node on our stack! We can use that to classify the sentence.

## Obtaining the transition sequence

So what goes on in the `transitions_from_treestring` function?

The idea ([explained in this blog post](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/recursive-neural-networks-pytorch/)) is that, if we had a tree, we could traverse through the tree, and every time that we find a node containing only a word, we output a SHIFT.
Every time **after** we have finished visiting the children of a node, we output a REDUCE.
(What is this tree traversal called?)

However, our `transitions_from_treestring` function operates directly on the string representation. It works as follows.

We start with the representation:

```
(3 (2 It) (4 (4 (2 's) (4 (3 (2 a) (4 (3 lovely) (2 film))) (3 (2 with) (4 (3 (3 lovely) (2 performances)) (2 (2 by) (2 (2 (2 Buy) (2 and)) (2 Accorsi))))))) (2 .)))
```

First we remove pre-terminal nodes (and add spaces before closing brackets):

```
(3 It (4 (4 's (4 (3 a (4 lovely film ) ) (3 with (4 (3 lovely performances ) (2 by (2 (2 Buy and )  Accorsi ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
```

Then we remove node labels:

```
( It ( ( 's ( ( a ( lovely film ) ) ( with ( ( lovely performances) ( by ( ( Buy and )  Accorsi ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
```

Then we remove opening brackets:

```
It 's a lovely film ) ) with lovely performances ) by Buy and ) Accorsi ) ) ) ) ) ) . ) )
```

Now we replace words by S (for SHIFT), and closing brackets by R (for REDUCE):

```
S S S S S R R S S S R S S S R S R R R R R R S R R
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 
```

Et voila. We just obtained the transition sequence!
"""

# for comparison
seq = ex.transitions
s = " ".join(["S" if t == 0 else "R" for t in seq])
print(s)
print(" ".join(map(str, seq)))

"""## Coding the Tree LSTM

The code below contains a Binary Tree LSTM cell.
It is used in the TreeLSTM class below it, which in turn is used in the TreeLSTMClassifier.
The job of the TreeLSTM class is to encode a complete sentence and return the root node.
The job of the TreeLSTMCell is to return a new state when provided with two children (a reduce action). By repeatedly calling the TreeLSTMCell, the TreeLSTM will encode a sentence. This can be done for multiple sentences at the same time.

"""## Explanation of the TreeLSTM class


The code below contains the TreeLSTM class, which implements everything we need in order to encode a sentence from word embeddings. The calculations are the same as in the paper, implemented such that the class `TreeLSTMCell` above is as general as possible and only takes two children to reduce them into a parent. 


**Initialize $\mathbf{h}$ and $\mathbf{c}$ outside of the cell for the leaves**

At the leaves of each tree the children nodes are **empty**, whereas in higher levels the nodes are binary tree nodes that *do* have a left and right child (but no input $x$). By initializing the leaf nodes outside of the cell class (`TreeLSTMCell`), we avoid if-else statements in the forward pass.

The `TreeLSTM` class (among other things) pre-calculates an initial $h$ and $c$ for every word in the sentence. Since the initial left and right child are 0, the only calculations we need to do are based on $x$, and we can drop the forget gate calculation (`prev_c_l` and `prev_c_r` are zero). The calculations we do in order to initalize $h$ and $c$ are then:

$$
c_1 =  W^{(u)}x_1 \\
o_1 = \sigma (W^{(i)}x_1) \\
h_1 = o_1 \odot \text{tanh}(c_1)$$
*NB: note that these equations are chosen as initializations of $c$ and $h$, other initializations are possible and might work equally well.*

**Sentence Representations**

All our leaf nodes are now initialized, so we can start processing the sentence in its tree form. Each sentence is represented by a buffer (initially a list with a concatenation of $[h_1, c_1]$ for every word in the reversed sentence), a stack (initially an empty list) and a transition sequence. To encode our sentence, we construct the tree from its transition sequence as explained earlier. 

*A short example that constructs a tree:*

We loop over the time dimension of the batched transition sequences (i.e. row by row), which contain values of 0's, 1's and 2's (representing SHIFT, REDUCE and padding respectively). If we have a batch of size 2 where the first example has a transition sequence given by [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1] and the second by [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], our transition batch will be given by the following two-dimensional numpy array:

$$
\text{transitions} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0\\ 
0 & 0\\ 
1 & 1\\ 
0 & 0\\ 
0 & 0\\ 
0 & 1\\ 
1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The inner loop (`for transition, buffer, stack in zip(t_batch, buffers, stacks)`) goes over each example in the batch and updates its buffer and stack. The nested loop for this example will then do roughy the following:

```
Time = 0:  t_batch = [0, 0], the inner loop performs 2 SHIFTs. 

Time = 1:  t_batch = [0, 0], ".."

Time = 2:  t_batch = [1, 1], causing the inner loop to fill the list child_l and child_r for both examples in the batch. Now the statement if child_l will return True, triggering a REDUCE action to be performed by our Tree LSTM cell with a batch size of 2. 

Time = 3:  t_batch = [0, 0], "..".

Time = 4:  t_batch = [0, 0], ".."

Time = 5:  t_batch = [0, 1], one SHIFT will be done and another REDUCE action will be performed by our Tree LSTM, this time of batch size 1.  

Time = 6:  t_batch = [1, 2], triggering another REDUCE action with batch size 1.
```
*NB: note that this was an artificial example for the purpose of demonstrating parts of the code, the transition sequences do not necessarily represent actual trees.*

**Batching and Unbatching**

Within the body of the outer loop over time, we use the functions for batching and unbatching. 

*Batching*

Before passing two lists of children to the reduce layer (an instance of `TreeLSTMCell`), we batch the children as they are at this point a list of tensors of variable length based on how many REDUCE actions there are to perform at a certain time step across the batch (let's call the length `L`). To do an efficient forward pass we want to transform the list to a pair of tensors of shape `([L, D], [L, D])`, which the function `batch` achieves. 

*Unbatching*

In the same line where we batched the children, we unbatch the output of the forward pass to become a list of states of length `L` again. We do this because we need to loop over each example's transition at the current time step and push the children that are reduced into a parent to the stack.

*The batch and unbatch functions let us switch between the "PyTorch world" (Tensors) and the Python world (easy to manipulate lists).*

"""# Further experiments and report

For your report, you are expected to answer research questions by doing further experiments.

## Research Questions

Make sure you cover at least the following:

- How important is word order for this task?
- Does the tree structure help to get a better accuracy?
- How does performance depend on the sentence length? Compare the various models. Is there a model that does better on longer sentences? If so, why?
- Do you get better performance if you supervise the sentiment **at each node in the tree**? You can extract more training examples by treating every node in each tree as a separate tree. You will need to write a function that extracts all subtrees given a treestring. 
    - Warning: NLTK's Tree function seems to result in invalid trees in some cases, so be careful if you want to parse the string to a tree structure before extraction the phrases.

Optionally, you can also investigate the following:

- When making a wrong prediction, can you figure out at what point in the tree (sentence) the model fails? You can make a prediction at each node to investigate.
- How does N-ary Tree LSTM compare to the Child-Sum Tree LSTM? 
- How do the Tai et al. Tree LSTMs compare to Le & Zuidema's formulation?
- Or.. your own research question!

In general:

- ***When you report numbers, please report the mean accuracy across 3 (or more) runs with different random seed, together with the standard deviation.*** This is because the final performance may vary per random seed.

## Report instructions

Your report needs to be written in LaTeX. You are required to use the ACL 2018 template [(zip)](https://acl2018.org/downloads/acl18-latex.zip) which you can edit directly on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-acl-2018-proceedings/xzmhqgnmkppc). Make sure your names and student numbers are visible at the top. (Tip: you need to uncomment `/aclfinalcopy`).
You can find some general tips about writing a research paper [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/), but note that you need to make your own judgment about what is appropriate for this project. 

We expect you to use the following structure:
1. Introduction (~1 page) - describe the problem, your research questions and goals, a summary of your findings and contributions. Please cite related work (models, data set) as part of your introduction here, since this is a short paper.
    - Introduce the task and the main goal
    - Clear research questions
    - Motivating the importance of the questions and explaining the expectations
    - How are these addressed or not addressed in the literature
    - What is your approach
    - Short summary of your findings
2. Background (~1/2-1 page) -
cover the main techniques ("building blocks") used in your project (e.g. word embeddings, LSTM, Tree LSTM) and intuitions behind them. Be accurate and concise.
    - How each technique that you use works (don't just copy the formulas)
    - The relation between the techniques
3. Models (~1/2 page) - Cover the models that you used.
    - The architecture of the final models (how do you use LSTM or Tree LSTM for the sentiment classification task. what layers you have, how do you do classification? What is your loss function?)
4. Experiments (~1/2 page) - Describe your experimental setup. The information here should allow someone else to re-create your experiments. Describe how you evaluate the models.
    - Explain the task and the data
    - Training the models (model, data, parameters and hyper parameters if the models, training algorithms, what supervision signals you use, etc.)
    - Evaluation (e.g. metrics)
5. Results and Analysis (~1 page). Go over the results and analyse your findings.
    - Answer each of the research questions you raised in the introduction.
    - Plots and figures highlighting interesting patterns
    - What are the factors that makes model A  better than model B in task C? investigate to prove their effect!
6. Conclusion (~1/4 page). The main conclusions of your experiments.
    - What you learned from you experiments? how does it relate to what is already known in the literature?
    - Where the results as expected ? any surprising results? why?
    - Based on what you learned what would you suggest to do next?


General Tips:

- Math notation – define each variable (either in running text, or in a pseudo-legenda after or before the equation)
- Define technical terminology you need
- Avoid colloquial language – everything can be said in a scientific-sounding way
- Avoid lengthy sentences, stay to the point!
- Do not spend space on "obvious" things!


An ideal report:
- Precise, scientific-sounding, technical, to the point 
  - Little general “waffle”/chit-chat
- Not boring – because you don’t explain obvious things too much
- Efficient delivery of (only) the facts that we need to know to understand/reimplement
- Results visually well-presented and described with the correct priority of importance of sub-results
- Insightful analysis – speculation should connect to something interesting and not be too much; the reader “learns something new”
- No typos, no colloquialisms – well-considered language
- This normally means several re-draftings (re-orderings of information)
